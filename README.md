## About Me

Highly skilled and experienced Software Engineer with a passion for building and deploying applications. I have over 20 years of professional experience in front-end and back-end development, with expertise in technologies such as Azure, Laravel, Nuxt/Vue.js, Next.js, Python, TypeScript, React.js, PHP, and more. I am dedicated to driving website accessibility, optimizing performance, and ensuring scalability. I thrive in collaborative environments, continuously seeking opportunities for improvement and growth.

## Projects

- [DeepFreeze](https://github.com/johncarmack1984/deep-freeze): A Dropbox to Amazon S3 migration tool written in Rust that uses a local SQLite database to track the migration status. It is designed to handle large migrations and recover from failures.
- [DropVault](https://github.com/johncarmack1984/migrate-to-s3-deep-storage-for-business): A terraform script for requisitioning the EC2 container for DeepFreeze, which then can migrate up to 16TB of data from DropBox Business to S3 Deep Storage. Aims to be a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for migrating to long-term data archival.
- [Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/johncarmack1984/sentiment-analyzer): Hey team, I do legacy software too. Flask-based app using TextBlob for simple sentiment analysis. Deployed on AWS Lambda with Zappa. Fun project with jQuery, Google fonts, and because it's me, Tailwind.
- [OpenAI Data Viz: String Embeddings](https://github.com/johncarmack1984/nuxt-w-openai-embedding-data-viz): Experience the simplicity of this NuxtJS application designed to showcase OpenAI's string embeddings. Discover insights by fetching data related to a specific string and visualizing its embeddings on a line graph. Future enhancements are planned for real-time updates to further engage users.
